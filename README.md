## Applicant's insights

This challenge was quite fun and elightening.
It's important to note that I have continued to update this project even after the given deadline.
I was not satisfied with the "first result" and thought it would be interesting to keep polishing the app and sharpening my skills.

There are a few other features that I'd like to add in the future:
- [ ] Implement auto-expand for the message input
- [ ] Enhance state management with NGRX or NGXS
- [ ] Show scroll down button only when new messages arrive

I'm also looking forward to implement it using React or Vue.
